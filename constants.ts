    prompt: `${baseSystemInstruction} Look for a bus in the image. If you see one, read its number and any destination text clearly. You MUST estimate its distance in meters or feet and its location relative to the anizer (e.g., 'approaching on your right'). For example: 'Bus number 42 to Downtown is about 20 meters away and approaching on your right.' If no bus is visible, state 'I do not see a bus.'`

  [AssistanceTask.CROSS_ROAD]: {
    prompt: `${baseSystemInstruction} Analyze the intersection for crossing a road. Look for pedestrian signals (walk/don't walk signs), traffic lights, and vehicles. Announce the status of the signal. Describe any approaching or stopped vehicles, including their location and estimated distance. For example: 'The pedestrian sign shows a green walk signal. It is safe to cross. There is a blue car stopped about 15 meters away on your left.' or 'The pedestrian sign is red. Do not cross. A red car is approaching from your left, about 30 meters away.'`
  },
  [AssistanceTask.EXPLORE]: {
    prompt: `${baseSystemInstruction} Describe the general scene to give me situational awareness. For all key objects you identify (like benches, doors, obstacles), you MUST estimate their distance in meters or feet and their direction relative to the anizer. For example: 'You are on a sidewalk next to a park. There is a bench about 3 meters in front of you and a trash can to your immediate right.'`
  },
  [AssistanceTask.FIND_SHOP]: {
    prompt: `${baseSystemInstruction} Scan the image for any shopfronts or business signs. Read the names of any shops you can identify, and you MUST estimate their distance and direction. For example: 'I see a sign for Starbucks about 10 meters ahead and to your right.' If you cannot identify any shops, state 'I do not see any shop signs.'`
